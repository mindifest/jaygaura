<h3 id="common-ground-as-a-basis-for-discussion">Common Ground as a Basis for Discussion</h3>

<p>We humans naturally develop worldviews and opinions, which often lead us into discussions—or even debates. In any meaningful exchange of ideas, establishing clear common ground becomes crucial—a foundation that all parties can agree on. But what exactly is this common ground if we consider a global or objective truth? I have my own thoughts on the matter, which I’ll share below for you to reflect on. Let’s see if we can find agreement or consensus, or perhaps even spark a discussion.</p>

<p>We also need a shared way to measure progress. Without a mutual understanding of what progress looks like, how can we decide if we’re heading in the right direction? For some, the release of the latest iPhone represents a clear milestone in human advancement. Others might argue that such technology makes us more distracted, less connected to the world around us.</p>

<p>My hope is that the “common ground” I mentioned earlier can also serve as a shared framework for evaluating progress. Below, I’ll outline my own view—let’s see where we stand.</p>

<h3 id="seekers-of-joy-and-fulfillment">Seekers of Joy and Fulfillment</h3>

<p>One fundamental truth, which I believe we can all agree on, is that human beings are driven by an unyielding desire for joy and happiness. This impulse guides everything we do, shaping our choices and our actions. When someone makes a sacrifice, whether for family, community, or country, it’s motivated by love. And the remarkable thing about love is that it brings joy, even in sacrifice—because love, at its core, is rewarding. Artists create because they love expressing their innermost emotions, scientists work tirelessly out of passion and faith, all in pursuit of fulfillment and happiness. Even wrongful acts, at their root, stem from a misguided belief that they will bring pleasure or gain. We may disagree on the method, but the aim is universal: to experience joy.</p>

<p>The Bible tells us that man is made in God’s image, and many spiritual traditions, including Gaudiya Vaishnavism, describe God as the ultimate enjoyer. In this specific tradition, God—Krishna—is portrayed as the supreme lover, engaged in eternal pastimes filled with divine joy and love. Other religions also emphasize God’s love, mercy, and kindness, closely linked to the idea of joy and fulfillment.</p>

<p>If God is the supreme enjoyer and the ultimate beloved, what does that make us, being created in His image? It makes us seekers—driven by the desire for joy and pleasure, though on a much smaller scale. God, however, has already found eternal fulfillment and exists in perfect harmony and love. In contrast, we are still on the journey, often seeking happiness in temporary or material things. This pursuit can sometimes lead us astray.</p>

<p>Love is the key to true joy, and finding the love of God is the pinnacle of this search. While love in this world—such as love for children—is powerful, it is often transactional and rooted in the workings of nature. Parents love and protect their children, and later in life, they hope to receive love, support, and appreciation in return. Divine love, on the other hand, is unchanging and causeless. God’s love transcends time, space, and even life itself.</p>

<p>This is why the love of God is considered the highest form of love, the ultimate fulfillment. While the material world keeps us restless and searching, divine love brings an end to that quest. It offers a peace and contentment that surpasses all worldly experiences. The search ends, and peace follows.</p>

<h3 id="progress-measurement">Progress Measurement</h3>

<p>So, how do we measure progress? If happiness is the goal, we need to assess how much happier and fulfilled we’ve become. As the soul becomes more content, the desire for external things—along with the tension from competing for resources—should diminish. If you’re already fulfilled, what more is there to chase?</p>

<p>The wars, political struggles, and relentless competition we see around us indicate that both individuals and society are far from fulfilled. We sense this lack, and although we haven’t found true happiness, our frantic search continues—often in destructive ways. Instead of rushing headlong into conflict and chaos, maybe it’s time to pause, reassess, and think beyond the usual methods. If happiness and fulfillment are truly our goals, why do we so often contribute to war and discord? Are these really paths to happiness, or are they steering us toward self-destruction?</p>
